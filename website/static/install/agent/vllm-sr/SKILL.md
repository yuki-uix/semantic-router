# vLLM Semantic Router

Use the CLI and Router API directly. The Dashboard is optional and must not be
a dependency of this workflow. The user's instructions and deployment
boundaries take precedence over this skill.

## Authoritative contracts

- Treat the installed CLI help, the running Router's discovery response, JSON
  Schema, and OpenAPI document as the current source of truth.
- Discover progressively. Start with `vllm-sr config schema`, then request only
  the relevant `--section` or `--surface`. Use `--full` only when the complete
  contract is required.
- Discover Router operations from `GET /api/v1`; fetch the full or filtered
  OpenAPI document from `/openapi.json` when request and response details are
  needed.
- Do not reuse remembered fields or endpoints when runtime discovery is
  available.

## Workflow

1. Clarify the requested outcome and inspect the host, existing installation,
   current config, model endpoints, container runtime, and accelerator with
   read-only commands. Check accelerator inventory vendor-neutrally; a missing
   NVIDIA or AMD utility alone is not evidence that the host has no GPU.
2. If the CLI is missing, install the stable release without starting or
   changing a runtime yet:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://vllm-sr.ai/install.sh | \
     bash -s -- --channel stable --mode cli --runtime skip --no-launch
   vllm-sr --version
   ```

3. Inspect `vllm-sr serve --help` and select the deployment path that matches
   the actual host. Do not assume a GPU platform. Do not expose a management
   listener publicly unless the user explicitly requests and secures it.
4. Discover the config surface before writing YAML:

   ```bash
   vllm-sr config schema
   vllm-sr config schema --section providers.models
   vllm-sr config schema --section routing.modelCards
   vllm-sr config schema --section routing.decisions.modelRefs
   ```

   Use `vllm-sr config schema --surface KIND:NAME` for a selected signal,
   projection, algorithm, or plugin. Section requests return compact field
   directories; follow their child paths and use `--expanded` only when a
   self-contained section schema is required.
5. Start from the running configuration when one exists by reading
   `vllm-sr config get`; otherwise create `config.yaml` with
   `vllm-sr config init`. Preserve fields outside the requested change.
   A physical model must be present in `providers.models`, represented by a
   matching `routing.modelCards` entry, and referenced from the applicable
   `routing.decisions[].modelRefs` before it can receive routed traffic. Keep
   credentials in environment variables and store only environment references
   in the config.
6. Validate locally, then ask the running Router to plan the exact mutation:

   ```bash
   vllm-sr config validate --config config.yaml
   vllm-sr config plan --config config.yaml
   ```

7. Review the plan. A `RESTART_REQUIRED` result means the candidate changes a
   listener or provider backend topology rendered into Envoy. Do not call the
   Router apply API for that candidate. For a local Docker deployment, ask
   before disrupting the running stack, then explicitly replace its active
   runtime config from the reviewed source document:

   ```bash
   vllm-sr serve --config config.yaml --replace-active-config
   ```

   Without `--replace-active-config`, `serve` preserves Dashboard or Recipe
   changes in active runtime state. The flag cannot replace an active Recipe
   package; change that package through its Recipe workflow. Apply a
   hot-reloadable candidate only when it matches the user's requested scope:

   ```bash
   vllm-sr config apply --config config.yaml
   ```

8. Check routing separately from backend execution:

   ```bash
   vllm-sr route preview \
     --model vllm-sr/auto \
     --prompt 'Explain why this request should take this route.' \
     --trace --json

   vllm-sr route probe \
     --config config.yaml \
     --base-url http://localhost:8899/v1 \
     --model vllm-sr/auto \
     --prompt 'Return exactly: route-ok'
   ```

   Preview proves the decision path without invoking a model. Probe sends a
   real request through Envoy and records end-to-end evidence. `--base-url`
   accepts either the listener origin or its OpenAI `/v1` root. Use
   `--expect-selected-model` to assert the Router receipt and, when the backend
   exposes a stable top-level OpenAI `model`, `--expect-response-model` to prove
   which upstream answered. These are different assertions; a selected-model
   header alone does not prove data-plane delivery.
9. For optimization, capture a baseline, make one coherent recipe change,
   validate and plan it, run representative previews and probes, and compare
   the requested quality, cost, latency, or safety objective. Keep a change
   only when the evidence improves the objective without violating hard
   constraints.
10. Run the reproducible benchmark workflow only when the user asks for model
    or Mixture-of-Models evaluation. Begin with
    `vllm-sr benchmark intelligence plan --help`; keep benchmark revisions,
    commands, results, and runtime identity together.

## Boundaries

- Never print, commit, or place secret values in command arguments or YAML.
- Ask before privileged actions, destructive changes, public exposure, or
  stopping unrelated services. Resolve exact container and file targets first.
- Preserve existing user configuration and unrelated workloads.
- Do not treat routing preview as model-quality evidence, a selected-model
  header as backend-delivery evidence, or one end-to-end probe as proof that
  every routing branch is correct; use the applicable assertions and benchmarks.
- Leave the user with the config path, active revision, validation result,
  routing evidence, and any remaining limitation.

See the [Router API](https://vllm-sr.ai/docs/api/router) and
[agent evaluation loop](https://vllm-sr.ai/docs/benchmarking/agent-evaluation-loop)
when the task needs the full contract.
