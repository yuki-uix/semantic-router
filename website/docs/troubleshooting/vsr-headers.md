# VSR routing headers

The router uses these request and response headers for session continuity,
routing observability, replay correlation, and opt-in debugging.

## What appears by default

The router splits headers across two surfaces:

- **Default surface** — every non-cache-hit response includes
  `x-vsr-schema-version` and `x-vsr-response-path`. Successful routed responses
  can also include the final recipe, decision, confidence, algorithm, model,
  routing latency, cost, and replay id. Protocol markers appear when translation occurs; protocol
  warnings appear only when there are warnings.
- **Debug surface** — intermediate classification details, matched signals,
  tool-selection metrics, and `x-vsr-retention-*` directives appear inline
  only when the request sets `x-vsr-debug: true`. When replay is enabled, the
  same diagnostic context remains available through `x-vsr-replay-id`.

Decision and matched-signal headers additionally require all of the following:

1. The upstream response is successful (`2xx`).
2. The response was not served from the response cache.
3. The router evaluated a routing decision or signal for the request.

Cache-hit responses can emit cache headers, but they do not re-run routing and therefore do not attach fresh matched-signal headers.

## Request headers

| Header | Direction | Description |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- |
| `x-session-id` | request | Stable client-provided session identifier for Chat Completions. Router Learning protection uses this, together with the configured conversation identity, to reason about stay-vs-switch decisions across turns. |
| `x-conversation-id` | request | Stable client-provided conversation or agent-run identifier. Router Learning protection uses this by default when `scope: conversation`. |
| `x-claude-code-session-id` | request | Conversation identifier supplied by Claude Code on Messages API requests. `x-session-id` takes precedence when both are present. |
| `x-disable-router-memory` | request | Set to `true` when the client already injects memory and router-managed memory would duplicate it. |
| `x-vsr-skip-processing` | request | Opts a request out of router processing when `global.router.skip_processing.enabled` is enabled. Use value `true`. |
| `x-vsr-debug` | request | Opts the request into verbose/debug response headers — headers the contract otherwise omits or demotes to replay are emitted inline for that request. Use value `true`. |

## Protocol and replay headers

| Header | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `x-vsr-client-protocol` | Inbound protocol shape seen by the router, for example `openai` or `anthropic`. Emitted only on cross-protocol handling (client protocol differs from upstream), or when `x-vsr-debug` is set. |
| `x-vsr-upstream-protocol` | Protocol shape sent to the selected upstream backend. Emitted only on cross-protocol handling, or when `x-vsr-debug` is set. |
| `x-vsr-protocol-warnings` | Comma-separated protocol translation warnings encoded as `severity;reason;field`. Emitted only when warnings exist. |
| `x-vsr-replay-id` | Opaque router replay record identifier for correlating a response with replay/Insights data. |

## Response warnings

| Header | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `x-vsr-response-warnings` | Comma-separated response-quality warning codes for the completion, in fixed order: `hallucination`, `unverified_factual`, `response_jailbreak`. Emitted only when at least one applies. |

Per-warning detail, such as hallucination spans or jailbreak confidence, is
kept in the replay record instead of being expanded into response headers.

## Decision headers

Final routing facts use the default surface. Intermediate details, including
Router Learning observability, require `x-vsr-debug`.

| Header | Surface | Description | Example |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `x-vsr-selected-recipe` | default | Routing isolation scope selected by an entrypoint or auto/looper alias. Omitted for concrete backend passthrough. | `support` |
| `x-vsr-selected-decision` | default | Final decision selected by the decision engine. | `complex-request` |
| `x-vsr-selected-confidence` | default | Confidence score for the selected decision. | `0.9100` |
| `x-vsr-applied-unknown-policy` | default | Decisions whose unknown result was resolved by `rules.on_unknown`, as `decision=policy` pairs. Also set on the `fail_request` 503. | `guarded=no_match` |
| `x-vsr-selected-algorithm` | default | Model-selection algorithm used after the decision matched. | `static` |
| `x-vsr-selected-model` | default | Logical model alias selected by the router. | `reasoning-model` |
| `x-vsr-routing-latency-ms` | default | Time the router spent choosing the model, in milliseconds with sub-millisecond precision. | `0.412` |
| `x-vsr-selected-category` | debug | Domain/category classifier result when domain routing runs. | `math` |
| `x-vsr-selected-reasoning` | debug | Reasoning mode selected for the request. | `on` |
| `x-vsr-selected-modality` | debug | Modality result and optional method. | `AR;classifier` |
| `x-vsr-session-phase` | debug | Protection trace phase from the selected routing policy. Detailed learning actions are exposed through the `x-vsr-learning-*` headers and Router Replay. | `user_turn`, `tool_loop`, `provider_state` |
| `x-vsr-learning-methods` | debug | Router Learning methods summarized by this response. Full score/cache details live in Router Replay. | `adaptation,protection` |
| `x-vsr-learning-actions` | debug | Method-keyed compact learning actions. | `adaptation=propose_switch,protection=allow_switch` |
| `x-vsr-learning-scopes` | debug | Method-keyed identity scopes used by learning. | `protection=conversation` |
| `x-vsr-learning-reasons` | debug | Method-keyed machine-readable reasons for actions. | `adaptation=sampled_win,protection=switch_allowed` |
| `x-vsr-injected-system-prompt` | debug | Whether a system-prompt plugin injected text into the request. | `true` |

For UI display guidance, translate `x-vsr-learning-actions` into user-facing
phrases such as `tool/protocol pinned`, `model switched`, or `learning bypassed`.
Fresh conversation or session-start diagnostics are usually useful only in debug
views, where they should be shown as neutral status text rather than a primary
route state.

## Matched signal headers

Matched signal headers contain comma-separated rule names. They require
`x-vsr-debug` and are omitted when that signal family did not match.

| Header | Signal family |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `x-vsr-matched-keywords` | `keyword` |
| `x-vsr-matched-embeddings` | `embedding` |
| `x-vsr-matched-domains` | `domain` |
| `x-vsr-matched-fact-check` | `fact_check` |
| `x-vsr-matched-user-feedback` | `user_feedback` |
| `x-vsr-matched-reask` | `reask` |
| `x-vsr-matched-preference` | `preference` |
| `x-vsr-matched-language` | `language` |
| `x-vsr-matched-context` | `context` |
| `x-vsr-context-token-count` | Context token estimate used by `context` |
| `x-vsr-matched-structure` | `structure` |
| `x-vsr-matched-complexity` | `complexity` |
| `x-vsr-matched-modality` | `modality` |
| `x-vsr-matched-authz` | `authz` |
| `x-vsr-matched-jailbreak` | `jailbreak` |
| `x-vsr-matched-pii` | `pii` |
| `x-vsr-matched-kb` | `kb` |
| `x-vsr-matched-conversation` | `conversation` |
| `x-vsr-matched-event` | `event` |
| `x-vsr-matched-input-modality` | `input_modality` |

## Projection headers

| Header | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `x-vsr-matched-projections` | Comma-separated projection mapping outputs that matched the request. |

Projection scores and full projection traces are stored in router replay records rather than expanded into response headers. Use `x-vsr-replay-id` to inspect those details in the Dashboard or through the authenticated Router management API; public inference listeners do not serve replay records.

## Retention headers

When a matched decision emits a retention directive, debug responses expose
the fields that were set. These headers help operators verify policy wiring;
clients should not use them as commands.

| Header | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `x-vsr-retention-drop` | Whether the response should be excluded from response-cache retention. |
| `x-vsr-retention-ttl-turns` | Decision-level retention lifetime expressed in conversation turns. |
| `x-vsr-retention-keep-current-model` | Whether the policy asks later routing to keep the current model. |
| `x-vsr-retention-prefer-prefix` | Whether prefix retention is preferred when the runtime supports it. |

Unset fields are omitted. Cache hits do not emit these headers because no
decision was evaluated for that response.

## Cost headers

On a buffered (non-streaming) response, the router prices the usage the model
reported with the served model's `pricing` configuration. This is a
configured-price figure, not a provider bill. Streamed responses and models
without `pricing` omit both headers.

| Header | Surface | Description | Example |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `x-vsr-cost` | default | Usage tokens multiplied by the served model's configured prices. | `0.000054` |
| `x-vsr-cost-currency` | default | Currency of `x-vsr-cost`, from `pricing.currency`. | `USD` |

## Cache and plugin headers

`x-vsr-cache-hit` and `x-vsr-fast-response` identify an immediate response on
the default surface. Cache-similarity and tool-selection metrics require
`x-vsr-debug`.

| Header | Surface | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| `x-vsr-cache-hit` | default | Response came from the response cache. |
| `x-vsr-fast-response` | default | Response was generated by the `fast_response` plugin without an upstream model call. |
| `x-vsr-cache-similarity` | debug | Similarity score from the response-cache lookup. |
| `x-vsr-tools-strategy` | debug | Semantic tool-selection retriever strategy used for the request. |
| `x-vsr-tools-confidence` | debug | Highest tool-selection retriever similarity score. |
| `x-vsr-tools-latency-ms` | debug | Tool-selection retriever latency in milliseconds. |

## Example response

Default surface — keystone headers, final routing facts and the replay-id entry point:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
x-vsr-schema-version: 2
x-vsr-response-path: upstream
x-vsr-selected-recipe: default
x-vsr-selected-decision: complex-request
x-vsr-selected-confidence: 1.0000
x-vsr-selected-algorithm: static
x-vsr-selected-model: reasoning-model
x-vsr-replay-id: replay_01J...
```

With `x-vsr-debug: true` on the request, the demoted intermediate details and matched signals are emitted inline as well:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
x-vsr-schema-version: 2
x-vsr-response-path: upstream
x-vsr-selected-recipe: default
x-vsr-selected-decision: complex-request
x-vsr-selected-confidence: 1.0000
x-vsr-selected-algorithm: static
x-vsr-selected-model: reasoning-model
x-vsr-session-phase: tool_loop
x-vsr-matched-context: long-context
x-vsr-matched-projections: use-reasoning-model
x-vsr-replay-id: replay_01J...
```

## Compatibility and interpretation

- Use `x-vsr-schema-version` before parsing optional headers; the current value
  is `2`.
- `x-vsr-matched-projections` is the projection header. The singular form is
  not part of the public contract.
- Recipe names scope local signal, projection, decision, cache, replay, metric, and learning/session identities. Use `x-vsr-selected-recipe` together with the local decision/signal names when correlating a response with Insights or metrics.
- `event` is the public signal type used by decisions and DSL. Canonical YAML stores event rules under `routing.signals.events`, matching other plural signal containers.
- Router Learning uses router-owned online state internally. Users enable online model-choice learning through `global.router.learning.adaptation`, enable stability protection through `global.router.learning.protection`, pass stable identity headers, and optionally set `routing.decisions[].adaptations.mode`, component modes, or `adaptations.adaptation.candidate_set`. `scope: conversation` protects one `x-conversation-id`; `scope: session` protects the broader `x-session-id`. The old `routing.decisions[].algorithm.session_aware` shape is not part of the public contract.
